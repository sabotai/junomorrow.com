She is an Associate Professor of Game Design and Game Design Program Director at the City University of New York&rsquo;s Eugenio Mar&iacute;a de Hostos Community College. At Hostos, she has been developing the first public game design degree program in New York City since 2015. Prior to that, Morrow earned an MFA in Design and Technology from Parsons School of Design.

With over 10 years of experience as an award-winning photographer, she&rsquo;s had work featured in <em>The Guardian</em>, <em>Dwell</em> magazine and released 3 monographs of urban photography.</p>
<p>Her unusual games, often infused with dark humor, feature distinctive aesthetics and novel premises. Examples include <em>Oral Perspectives</em>, a VR game taking place inside the player&rsquo;s mouth, and <em>Mastering Tedium</em>, an existentialist laundry simulator played inside a text terminal. Recent work includes <em>Pruuds vs. Sloots</em>, a &ldquo;dumb versus game,&rdquo; <em>Blood Broker</em>, a human sacrifice management simulator, and <em>Marginalia</em>, a memoir examining intersections of mixed-race and transgender identities.</p>
