<p>Her unusual games, often infused with dark humor, feature distinctive aesthetics and novel premises. Examples include <em>Oral Perspectives</em>, a VR game taking place inside the player&rsquo;s mouth, and <em>Mastering Tedium</em>, an existentialist laundry simulator played inside a text terminal. Recent work includes <em>Pruuds vs. Sloots</em>, a &ldquo;dumb versus game,&rdquo; <em>Blood Broker</em>, a human sacrifice management simulator, and <em>Marginalia</em>, a memoir examining intersections of mixed-race and transgender identities.</p>
